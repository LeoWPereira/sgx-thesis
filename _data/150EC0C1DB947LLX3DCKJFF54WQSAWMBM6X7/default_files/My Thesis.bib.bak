  abstract = {
	
	Data security is a serious concern when we migrate data to a cloud
	DBMS. Database encryption, where sensitive columns are encrypted
	before they are stored in the cloud, has been proposed as a mechanism
	to address such data security concerns. The intuitive expectation
	is that an adversary cannot “learn” anything about the encrypted
	columns, since she does not have access to the encryption key. However,
	query processing becomes a challenge since it needs to “look inside”
	the data. This tutorial explores the space of designs studied in
	prior work on processing queries over encrypted data. We cover approaches
	based on both classic client-server and involving the use of a trusted
	hardware module where data can be securely decrypted. We discuss
	the security challenges that arise in both approaches and how they
	may be addressed. Briefly, supporting the full complexity of a modern
	DBMS including complex queries, transactions and stored procedures
	leads to significant challenges that we survey.},
